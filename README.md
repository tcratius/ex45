# ex45
Made a very simple game for ex45 not exactly polished and definitely not the greatest.  Problem was trying to marry each individual py file together. What I think I did well was the relationship between Human parent and fighter child class, same with Monster parent and bat child. I do believe it allow for "is many type scenario".  This was let down by the battle program which essentially only allowed for a "single" monster or human to be implemented.  Other issues I could not resolve was how I went from Intro to Battle and I went totally against Python Pep8 and Imported Battle.py at the end of intro.  Hopefully with time, this issue will be clearer and I can build it better.
